# Weighted Cluster Editing

This package provides an implementation of a branch-and-bound algorithm [cite] for the Weighted Cluster Editing Problem.
It features implementations of
upper bounds:
...
lower bounds:
...
data reduction rules:
...

## Benchmarks:
Datasets [cite]
Cactus-plot for comparison with Gurobi and KIT-Solver

## Getting started:
1. Docker...
2. clone repo
3. Download datasets...
4. Setup python
5. Setup gurobi
6. Run exact solver
